                    For many years, our family-owned Cafe has been a cozy spot where you can grab a bite to eat and feel at home.
                    We take pride in making - country gravy, biscuits, and cinnamon rolls from scratch.  We have an award winning
                    green chili (yes, we've earned bragging rights in a blind taste test!). Every week we have a Monday special and desserts, from cakes
                    and pies to danishes, all of which are lovingly homemade. Though we are small and cozy, the Hidden Cafe is big on flavor and heart - a 
                    place where you can relax, enjoy good food, and feel like part of the family.
