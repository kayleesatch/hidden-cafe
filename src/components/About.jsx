                    For many years, our family-owned Cafe has been a cozy spot where you can grab a bite to eat and feel at home.
                    We take pride in making - our country gravy, biscuits, and cinnamon rolls from scratch.  We have and award winning
                    green chili (yes, we've earned bragging right in a blind taste test!). Every Monday special and dessert, from cakes
                    and pies to danishes, are lovingly homemade. Though we are small and cozy, The Hidden Cafe is big on heart - a 
                    place where you can relax, enjoy good food, and feel like part of the family.
